# News Topic Modeling

Topic modeling involves extracting features from document terms using mathematical frameworks like matrix factorization and Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to generate clusters or groups of terms that are distinguishable from each other. These clusters of words form topics or concepts, which can help uncover patterns within a text corpus.

- What is Topic Modeling?

Topic modeling is an unsupervised machine learning technique used for:

* Discovering hidden themes in a collection of documents.

* Classifying documents based on discovered themes.

* Organizing, summarizing, and searching through large collections of documents.

It works similarly to clustering numeric data, identifying groups of words that often co-occur in documents.

Frameworks and Algorithms for Topic Modeling

The following frameworks and algorithms are commonly used for topic modeling:

* Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI)

* Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)

* Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF)

Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)

Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) is a generative probabilistic model where each document is assumed to be a mixture of topics, and each topic is a distribution of words. It is closely related to Probabilistic Latent Semantic Indexing (pLSI).

Key Concepts:

* Each document can be described by a distribution of topics.

* Each topic can be described by a distribution of words.

LDA Algorithm Steps:

Initialization: Randomly assign each word in each document to one of K topics (K is chosen beforehand).

Iteration: For each word w in document D:

Compute P(T | D) = Proportion of words in D assigned to topic T.

Compute P(W | T) = Proportion of all assignments to topic T across all documents containing word W.

Update: Reassign word W to a topic T with probability P(T | D) * P(W | T) considering all other words and their topic assignments.
